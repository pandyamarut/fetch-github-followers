# Overview of the APP.
It's a react app, which helps you in getting your github followers and helps you in searching in your followers. I have used the redux for state management
external dependencies:
1. redux, react-redux: for state management.
2. redux-thunk as a middleware, which keeps eye on response from the api and updates the store the following.
3. For UI components I have used the Material UI package, which provides the well designed componentts.
